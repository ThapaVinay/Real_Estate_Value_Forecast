# Real Estate Price Prediction Model

![Frontend Screenshot](/images/image_2.png)

This project aims to predict real estate prices using machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression. The model incorporates preprocessing, feature engineering, and comparison with other models like Lasso regression and decision trees. Additionally, a Flask backend and HTML files have been created to deploy the model through a web interface.


## Introduction

Predicting real estate prices accurately is crucial for various stakeholders in the real estate market, including buyers, sellers, and investors. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model for real estate prices. 

## Data

The dataset used for this project consists of various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc. Each record in the dataset represents a real estate property, and the target variable is the price of the property.

## Preprocessing

Before feeding the data into the machine learning model, several preprocessing steps are performed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering plays a significant role in improving the predictive performance of the model. New features are created based on domain knowledge and insights gained from exploratory data analysis.

## Model Comparison

Several machine learning models are compared to select the best-performing one. The models include linear regression, Lasso regression, and decision trees. Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared are used for comparison.

## Web Deployment

A Flask backend is developed to serve the trained machine learning model. HTML files are created to provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the model.
